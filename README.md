 Quotation Project

----------------------------##--------------------------------------

This project was built in Python and also created an executable file 

The executable file will invoke a window to run the application

To create the executable I used the cx-Freeze library
you can do a pip install cx-Freeze and run the following command
"cx-Freeze (pythonFileName.py)" directly from the terminal
